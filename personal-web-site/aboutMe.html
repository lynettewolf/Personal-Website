       My name is Lynette Hardinger and I'm an aspiring software engineer. I haven't always wanted
      to be a programmer. For a long time, I had dreamed of being an animator and graphic designer.
      But then everything changed when I took my first computer science class at Kansas State University.
      I grew to love computer science and will graduate May 2019 with a B.S. in Computer Science.

    <p class="aboutMe">
      As I was falling in love with computer science, I also fell in love with the man who would become my
      husband, Kendal. Though our interests are different - he graduated from K-State with a B.S. in Geography -
      our passion for learning is the same. Whether it's related to computers or
      geography, Star Wars or animation, we are always looking to learn!
