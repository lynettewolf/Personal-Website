      <p>Playing Dungeons and Dragons is one of my favorite hobbies, but I often see new players struggle with the
          somewhat overwhelming character creation sheets. Seeing so many of my friends get frustrated with the process
          inspired me to create this program. My goal was to assist new players
          with the task of creating a new character, from picking races and classes to autofilling stats and skill points. Though it is far from complete, I hope to see it fully implemented
          some day soon.

      <p> This video game was created for the 2017 Annual K-State Game Jam. I teamed up with Rayne Son, a fellow computer science student,
        to craft a game that exemplified the dangers of climate change, which was the theme of the jam. Players can choose to play as one of three extinct or nearly
        extinct species of animals. Jump from platform to platform to escape the rapidly rising water!<p>

      <p>This video game was one of my first ever programming creations. It was made as a final project in my
        introduction to computer science class and took a little less than a week to finish. Though it is a bit
        rough around the edges, it is my favorite of all the program I have made. Building this game made me realize
        not only that programming can be creative and fun, but that I could program almost anything if I put my mind to it.

      <p>This website was the first project in my web development course and was designed and implemented over the course of a week.
        While this is my first real foray into web development, I certainly hope it is not the last!
        It was thoroughly enjoyable to create and exciting to see a blank
        white page transform into a fully fleshed out website right before my eyes.
