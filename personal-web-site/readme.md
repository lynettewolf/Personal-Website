# ASSIGNMENT 1 - Personal Web Page
For this assignment, you are developing a personal web page that is primarily targeted at future employers.  As such, you should focus on your audience's primary concerns:

1. Do you possess the skills they need?
2. Will you fit into their working environment?
3. What sets you apart from other potential employees?

Your website should consist of (at a minimum):

1. A personal biography/about me piece introducing who you are in an interesting, narrative form.
2. A portfolio of projects you have worked on
3. Your resume
4. Your contact information

The site should also showcase your skills with HTML and CSS.  Make sure you use appropriate HTML elements and CSS rules to create a cohesive site.

## Rubric
* __Biography (10 Points)__ Biography is written in a narrative form, free from spelling and grammar errors, provides an adequate but not overwhelming picture of who you are. 
* __Portfolio (10 Points)__ Portfolio includes at least three examples of student or independent work. Source code and/or executables are available for each (can be links to GitHub or other external resources).  Purpose of project is described.  Description is free of spelling and grammar errors.
* __Resume (10 Points)__ Resume details education, skills, and recognition (awards).  Should identify specific technologies (programming languages, IDEs, libraries, etc.) student has proficiency in.  Think in terms of keywords an HR staff member scanning your resume will look for.
* __Aesthetics (10 Points)__ Your site looks appropriate for today (i.e. does not look like it was authored in the '90s). No clashing colors or overly busy patterns are used.  All font choices are legible at the specified sizes. You are not using more than three fonts. Simple and clean layouts are a good strategy.
* __HTML (20 Points)__ All pages in the site are valid HTML (you can use the [w3c validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check).  You should be use at least five different HTML elements in the body of your pages.
* __CSS (20 Points)__ CSS rules are applied to HTML elements in the page to apply customization.  Styles are consistent across all pages of the site (with the possible exception of the Resume, which may be styled for easy printing, or be an embedded pdf or similar).  CSS rules should be in a sitewide CSS file, linked to individual pages.
* __Multiple Pages (5 Points)__ Your website should consist of more than one webpage.  Pages should be linked to one another with anchor tags.
* __Images (10 Points)__ Your website should have at least two images in it.  At least one of them should be a picture of yourself.
* __Contact Info (5 Points)__ Provide information about how to contact you - email is a bare minimum.  Social network links can be appropriate, but be sure you use privacy controls to limit what a potential employer may see.
